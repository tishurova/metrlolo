# metrlolo
Around the world, a lot of big cities have a metro. This mean of transport can carry many people and there are no traffic jams with this vehicle. The first metro was
put into service in London in 1863. During the World War II London Underground was a shelter for people.
When the wartime had been over, the metro began to appear in many cities.
The cities grew, and the metro gave a solution to connect the centre of the city and its suburbs. Moreover, people could buy a ticket which had an affordable price. 
The metro could conquer the world fast, because it has a lot of advantages. It reduces road traffic, and it means that pollution is decreasing too.
Nowadays, the underground has more comfortable seats. There are escalators that can facilitate access to the platforms. 
Some stations have beautiful works of art. Their artists are not well-known as a rule, that is why these pictures have no great value. 
It helps to get rid of stealing. But the main thing is that they provide nice atmosphere. And it is very pleasant to be there. 
The Stockholm subway in Sweden is considered as the longest museum in the world.
The metro of the future will be automatic; it means that there will be no drivers in it. And it is supposed that there will be charging stations.
